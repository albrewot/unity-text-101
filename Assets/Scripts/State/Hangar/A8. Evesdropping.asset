  storyText: 'A8. Evesdropping


    You slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky
    looking men. The tall, scrawny one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered
    arrow shooter, while the shorter dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen
    small glass bottles with grey liquid inside.

    

    The stout fellow finishes
    cranking a large valve (clockwise you notice) and then both men dash off with
    much haste.

    

    What to do?

    

    1. Quick, uncrank that valve,
    they were clearly up to no good.

    2. Chase the men.'
